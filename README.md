# EECS4404_Machine_Learning



A2 & A3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of the assignments were to investigate the classification performance of neural networks. 
Nneural network was trained and used an effective way to avoid overfitting. 
All the implementations are done using Python and TensorFlow.

A2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset that we will use in this assignment is a permuted version of notMNIST1, which contains
28-by-28 images of 10 letters (A to J) in different fonts. This dataset has 18720 instances, which
can be divided into different sets for training, validation and testing.

A3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FaceScrub Dataset
This assignment will be done using the FaceScrub dataset. We will be using a tiny version of
this, with 6 celebrities and cropped images of 32-by-32. The target labels are the actor/actress
name, encoded as integers, as well as the gender, encoded as ’0’ and ’1’. 
The name (ID) of the actors: `Lorraine Bracco', `Gerard Butler', `Peri Gilpin', `Angie Har-mon', 
`Daniel Radclife', and `Michael Vartan' are encoded as `0', `1', `2', `3', `4', and `5', respectively.
The gender of the actors: `Male' and `Female' are encoded as `0' and `1', respectively.
